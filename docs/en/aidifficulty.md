# AI Difficulty System

## What is this?

This is the brand new system that allows to tweak settings related to zeds through server configs "on fly", and that way create various difficulty presets.

Currently the system is limited to custom zed parameters, but in future it will be expanded with few other mechanics, such as different effects based on damage type, zonal hit system for players and stuff like that.

Apart from that, it includes custom behaviour and stages of the bosses, generally making them harder.

All changes are organised into difficulty presets that can be switched back and forth during a match:

* [`!dcad`](commands.md#disable-custom-ai-difficulty) set to `false` enables the sytem, allowing to use custom zed presets;

* [`!ad`](commands.md#ai-difficulty) `<index>` switches between difficulty presets.

Available presets:

* `0` - Vanilla zeds;

* `1` - Pivo zeds;

* `2` - Harder zeds by Kore;

* `3` - Nightcore zeds by fanta.
