# Basic info

Welcome!

If you've ended up here, most probably you've typed out `!help` command on SPB-GS servers or have chosen respective menu button when pressing `J`.

Otherwise, you might want to know that there's a chat commander feature on SPB-GS servers that allow to modify certain settings.

A custom radial menu with commands is available through pressing `J` in game. It can be bound to a different hotkey with the following console command:

`setbind J GBA_ShowVoteComms`

Put whatever you want instead of `J` to bind the menu to a different hotkey.

Here is a quick overview of the SPB-GS Docs content:
