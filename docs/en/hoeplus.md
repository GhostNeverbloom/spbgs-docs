# Hell on Earth+ Basics

## What is HoE+?

^^Hell on Earth+^^ is a term used to describe any difficulty that is higher than Hell on Earth of the Vanilla game. It can be achieved with any mods and tweaks, so this term is not related to any specific solutions, such as [Controlled Difficulty](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513564310) or any others.

You may ask, "Then what is HoE++, Precision, and what's the difference between all these game modes?". Well, here's the answer:

* ^^HoE+^^ is a commonly accepted designation of the custom game difficulty, so it's used by many people and is free to interpret;

* ^^HoE++^^, however, is simply one of the HoE+ interpretations made by phanta, which is his `HoE++ | PRECISION PERKS ONLY` server;

* If other people use HoE++ in their server names, it's either a misconception or intentional reference to the existing similar servers, so don't get confused;

* ^^Precision^^ or ^^Precision-only^^ is a mode where chaos perks (such as Firebug, Demolitionist etc.) are disabled, and whole gameplay relies on Precision perks (Commando, Sharpshooter, Gunslinger etc.), making it more mechanical skill-based;

* [Controlled Difficulty](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513564310) is an entirely different thing that strongly relies on teamplay and good comms, therefore is not meant for pubs; though it's technically a variation of HoE+ in a certain way since it achieves similar goals. At the end of the day it's just one of the many options, same as long gone `Faked Suite` and `Project One` mods for example.

!!! tip "It's safe to say that HoE+ ^^is not^^ [CD](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513564310), but [CD](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2513564310) ^^is^^ HoE+."

Every author has their own vision of this game mode, so there's no HoE+ specific features, but most of them make use of similar set of settings:

* Tweaked spawn modifiers and [Game Conductor](https://wiki.killingfloor2.com/index.php?title=Mechanics_(Killing_Floor_2)#Gameplay_-_Game_Conductor) adjustments (the latter one is usually disabled and spawns are more intense);

* Modded amount of alive zeds on map ([MaxMonsters](commands.md#max-monsters)) and wave size;

* Modded zed spawn cycle, often aimed towards higher count of Larges and Mediums;

* Custom zed types and removed unwanted ones from the base game, such as King Crawlers, Quarter Pounds etc.;

* Zed health is fixed at values independent from the player count;

* Modded ammo count, and sometimes custom weapon mods.

These aren't mandatory of course, however they're all present in most cases depending on how strong the server modifications are.

[SPB-GS](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SPB-GS) servers have classic HoE+ server which is `#05.1`, and three Precision servers which are `#06`, `#07` and `#08`. There's two CD servers as well (`#08.1` and `#08.2`), but they're meant to be played in a fully stacked team, so they're private. Access to them is given individually to those players who are interested in playing CD privately.
